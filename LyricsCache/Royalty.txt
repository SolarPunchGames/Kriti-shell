Say I'm cold-hearted
But I'm just getting started
Got my eyes on the target
Now, now

'Til the battles are won
'Til kingdom come

I'll never run

Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty

Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty

They'll be calling me royalty

They say I'm dangerous, 'cause I
Broke all their cages
No, I won't sit and take it
Now, now

They left me for dead, I guess they'll never learn
Every time I break, there's just more pain to burn
They'll never, never, never learn

'Til the battles are won
'Til kingdom come

I'll never run

Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty

Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty

They'll be calling me royalty

They'll be calling me royalty
(Royalty, royalty, royalty)
They'll be calling me royalty
(Royalty, royalty, royalty)
